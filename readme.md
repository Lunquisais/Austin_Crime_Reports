    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a record of incidents which the Austin Police Department responded to and wrote a report for. Please note that this dataset only shows the highest level offense, though it may have several offenses associated with it. The data is from 2003 to present. This dataset is updated weekly and a similar or same search done on different dates can produce different results. Data provided represents only calls for police service where a report was written. Totals in the database may vary considerably from official totals following investigation and final categorization. Therefore, the data should not be used for comparisons with Uniform Crime Report statistics.  For further info please check out https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports-2018/vmn9-3bvu.\n",

    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "The top 5 crimes reported are: Burglary of Vehicle, Theft, Family Disturbance, Criminal Michief, and Burglary of Residence. In comparison to any other crime theft is the greatest reported, with Burglary of Vehicle being the most reported of thefts. Crime has been declining since 2009 and many report counts have been cut by a third of what they were in 2003. There was an increase in general theft in 2008 and family disturbance became the top reported crime from January 2014 to 2019. Since the beginning of the year Burglary of Vehicle has regained it's top spot as the highest reported crime.\n",

    "## Key Insights for Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Theft (including Burglary) are 3 out of the 5 top crimes. There has been a 31.5% decrease in the city's crime reporting with an overall downward trend. February is the month with the least amount of crimes reported. Crimes tend to occur in the summer months between May and October. During those 5 months there is a 20% increase in crime compared to February. The highest crime period was in March 2009 with 1,726 reports of crime while the lowest was in February 2015 with 758 reports. All things considered, a 60% increase in crime 6 years apart isn't that terrible.\n",

    "## Resources Used\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, thanks go out to my mentor Louis who saved my bacon on some tricky code. Not only did he take time away from family, he also explained what he was writing (and why) so I could get a better understanding of how to continue to get the results I wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Overflow and official documentation proved to be useful as always."
